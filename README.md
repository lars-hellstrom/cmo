# cmo: the Catalogue of Mathematical Objects

So far this is mostly a collection of notes, found in **vocabulary.dtx** (which is more a paper than source code, despite the extension).
To understand what this is all about, that is what you should start reading; it should just LaTeX straight off.

rdf.dtx will contain the source code for a package to be employed by the Catalogue (once that package gets written).
